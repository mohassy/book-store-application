# Book-Store-Application

This project is a Book Store application made in Java and JavaFX 

There are two types of users that can log into this application: the Book-Store owner(with "admin" as both the Username and Password) and customers who must be registed by the owners. 

**Roles:**
Once logged in the Book-Store owner can add books and customers to the database
If a customer logs in they will be presented with a table of all available books, they can buy books or redeem them with points they gained by previously buying other books.

**Database:**
The application uses a simple .txt file because there are only two simple tables in our database and using a DBMS would cost too much overhead without much benifit.
